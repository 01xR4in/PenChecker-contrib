# PenChecker

## Description

PenChecker is a student project carried out as part of our Master 1 year at Oteria Cyber School.
We wanted to create a tool based on a plug-and-play physical module that would enable any type of population to scan their local network and identify vulnerabilities.

## Features

The features currently available on the software are :
* Scanning and versioning of accessible machines
* Links service versions to known vulnerabilities
* Clear and simple report, with known remediation to be implemented

## How to push

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "add feature"
git push origin main
git tag vX.X
git push origin vX.X
```

## Special thanks

* Paul de Montalivet, Head of Training and Projects at Oteria Cyber School, for his guidance throughout the year.

* Laurent Ladreyt, IT Manager/Cybersecurity Referent at KROHNE France, who helped us come up with ideas for the development, accompanied us on the project and tested the solution on a perimeter of his company.

* To all the people who contacted us via LinkedIn to advise us and give their opinion on the features we had planned for our solution.
